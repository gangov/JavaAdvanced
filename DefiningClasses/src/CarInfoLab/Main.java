Horse Power: int
Create a new class and ensure proper naming
This method should return the info about any car object in the following format:
"The car is: {made} {model} â€“ {horsePower} HP."
You have to figure out how to create a method and to use it in the outside code as shown below

Read a cars objects, add them to collection of your chose and the print each one on the console using the carInfo()
method. The input consists of single integer N the number of lines representing car objects. One each line you will read
car info in the following format {make}  {model} {horsePower} separated by single space.
