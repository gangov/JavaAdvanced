The counting starts with the fistkid. Every nth toss the child left with the potato leaves the game. When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potatoforward. This continues repeating until there is only one kid left. Create a program that simulates the game of HotPotato.  Print every kid that is removed from the circle. In the end, print the kid that is left last. */public class HotPotatoLab {    public static void main(String[] args) {        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);        String[] names = scanner.nextLine().split(" ");        ArrayDeque<String> players = new ArrayDeque<>();        for (String name : names) {            players.offer(name);        }        int cycle = scanner.nextInt();        while (players.size() > 1) {            for (int i = 1; i < cycle; i++) {                players.offer(players.remove());            }            String removed = players.remove();            System.out.println("Removed " + removed);        }        System.out.println("Last is " + players.peek());    }}
